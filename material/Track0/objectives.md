# Introduction to parallel programming

## Course objectives:

- Introduce the concept of sequential computing and its limitations
- To present the concepts of concurrency (interruptability), parallelism (independentability) and distributed computing, and how they help to overcome some of the sequential computing's limitations
- Present Flynn's taxonomy
- Expose the concepts of Process and thread
- Present the fork-join model for parallel computing
- Expose the problem of race conditions and how to solve it using thread locks
- Present an example of parallelism

## Learnig outcomes:
- Explain the importance of parallel and distributed computing
- Identify sequential and potential parallel regions in a simple algorithm
- Detect possible race conditions
- Implement the fork-join model to reduce run time by parallelizing a simple algorithm
- Make use of thread locks to overcome race conditions, while decreasing run times
