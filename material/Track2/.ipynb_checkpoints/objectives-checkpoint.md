# Parallel computing with OpenMP

## Course objectives

- Write an compile C/C++ programs that use openMP precompiler directives
- Use openMP's fork-join model with omp parallel regions, setting the number of threads
- Sincronize threads using openMP's tools
- Variable scoping
- Parallelize for cycles with omp for and different schedule schemes. Use of reduction operations
- Parallelize algorithms using omp tasks

## Learning outcomes

- Recognize parallelizable regions within a code
- Recognize and set the scope of a variable
- Parallelize for lops using omp for and scheduling schemes
- Use omp tasks and conpare its performance with parallel for loops
